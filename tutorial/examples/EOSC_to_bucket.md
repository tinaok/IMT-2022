# How to connect your pangeo-eosc object storage using EGI check-in to your 'bucket' at pangeo-eosc-jupyter

We will need different 'token' 'key' to proceed with object storage. Here are the list of token and keys we'll create in this page.

- OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN
- openstack token
- aws_access_key_id
- aws_secret_access_key

## Setup your command line enviroment

First, we need a command line on your jupyterlab environment. Start a terminal from a launcher.
Then create an openstack environment using mamba.

```
mamba create -n openstack  python jq s3fs gcc awscli --yes  -c conda-forge
mamba deactivate
mamba activate openstack
```

## Connect your environment with EGI Check-In

If your access token is not created yet, create it at [https://aai.egi.eu/token/](https://aai.egi.eu/token/).

It is a very long string, but do not worry, copy and past it instead of `<your_token>` (without any space beofore or after the `=` sign) like below:

```
export OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_token>
```

Next, copy and paste following command to access pangeo object storage.

```
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://identity.cloud.muni.cz/v3
export OS_AUTH_TYPE=v3oidcaccesstoken
export OS_PROTOCOL=openid
export OS_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=egi.eu
export OS_ACCESS_TOKEN=$OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN
export OS_PROJECT_ID=57102d3e06b7476088fe4924370ae170
export OS_STORAGE_URL=https://object-store.cloud.muni.cz/swift/v1

openstack container list

```

If the last command returns something similar to

```
+------------+
| Name       |
+------------+
| WG1        |
| input-data |
| test-gey   |
| test-slv   |
| tmp        |
+------------+
```

then
you are good, properly identified and connected with EOSC cesnet hosted openstack based pangeo private backet..

## Retrieve Openstack token for Swift

You can run following command to retrive your openstack token
This token

```
$ openstack token issue -c id -f value
```

## Connect your environment with pangeo-eosc object storage.

You need a pair of Access and Secret keys (`aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`)
in order to have read-write access to pangeo-eosc object store space from your enviroment
through AWS S3 interface.

Use the following command to see if you already have those keys or not:

```
openstack ec2 credentials list
```

If you have nothing listed, then type the following command in order to create them:

```
openstack ec2 credentials create
```

Then list the credentials created by issuing the `credentials list` command :

```
openstack ec2 credentials list
```

This will provide you `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`

```

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Access                           | Secret                           | Project ID                       | User ID                                                          |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| x1xx | x2xx | x3xxxxxx | x4xxxxxx |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

```

Copy the values at `x1xx` and `x2xx` and past them instead of `x1xx` and `x2xx` in the next command:

```
aws configure set aws_access_key_id x1xx
aws configure set aws_secret_access_key x2xx
```

Now, you just need to choose which _bucket_ or object _container_ you'll use

Here is how you can list your available buckets on pangeo-eosc object storage.

In this example, we chose `your-github-name` as destination bucket, pushing the `tar/` local folder to this bucket.

```
aws s3 sync tar/ s3://your-github-name/ --endpoint-url https://object-store.cloud.muni.cz
```
